				<h3>strugee.net fallback domain</h3>
				<p>This is the fallback domain for services hosted under <code>strugee.net</code>. It exists to give a useful error message when no other reasonable action can be taken.</p>

				<h3>Reasons you may be seeing this webpage</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><p>If you visited <code>null.strugee.net</code> directly, this was served to you as a regular webpage. All is well.</p></li>
					<li><p>If you are unable to load any domain under <code>strugee.net</code> (including <code>strugee.net</code> itself) because you were redirected here, then the Apache webserver serving your request was unable to determine which domain you were requesting resources from.</p><p>The most likely reason for this is that you are running Internet Explorer version 6 or below. If this is the case, then please for the love of God upgrade your web browser (or even better, switch to <a href="https://affiliates.mozilla.org/referral/69013/">Firefox</a>). If this is not the case, please ensure that your browser is sending the <code>Host:</code> HTTP header. It may be that an extension is interfering with this functionality.</p></li>
					<li><p>You may have requested a webpage for a service that does not run over HTTP. For example, <code>imap.strugee.net</code> is designed to be used with IMAP, not HTTP, and thus does not serve HTTP requests.</p></li>
					<li><p>You may have requested a webpage for a service that uses HTTP, but has not been set up yet. This condition occurs when the administrator has set up a DNS record to reserve the name for future use, but has not set up the application that is to run on that subdomain.</li></p>
